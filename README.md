# Tip calculator app

![Design preview for the Tip calculator app coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this tip calculator app UI (No need to make it functional) and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

Your users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Calculate the correct tip and total cost of the bill per person

## Where to find everything

Your task is to build out the project to the designs inside the `/design` folder. You will find both a mobile and a desktop version of the design. 

The designs are in JPG static format. Using JPGs will mean that you'll need to use your best judgment for styles such as `font-size`, `padding` and `margin`. 


You will find all the required assets in the `/images` folder. The assets are already optimized.
